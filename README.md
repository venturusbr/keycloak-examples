# Keycloak Examples

These are identity and access management examples using Keycloak.
We will focus on how to use Keycloak provided tokens and endpoints and how we could configure them
to achieve a good and secure access management experience in our applications.

We are intended to provide lots of examples, incrementally, covering many use cases and in many languages 
to test and show easiness and particularities of each scenario.
## Important: This is not production ready code and environments. This is just for test, demo and study purposes!

Please, feel free to ask for other examples, ask questions and to make suggestions on our examples.
The main objective of this repository is to test and change experiences in applications access
management.
